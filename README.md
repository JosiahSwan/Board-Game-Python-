# Board-Game-Python-
This is a program I developed during my sophmore year of high school, before I had taken any formal programming classes. By this point all the programming knowledge I had was pretty much entirely from the robotics class in which I learned basic python, and additionally some from a few youtube tutorials, so pardon the somewhat messy code and slightly less than professional comments. This repository includes three different versions of this program. The first version is a very simple version with just the characters and no board, the purpose of this version was to design and test the logic for the characters and to design the turn system used. The second version includes a board and all the logic required to make it work, along with some general improvements to the character and turn systems. Finally, the third version has each player control two seperate characters, or alternatively could allow for 4 players with 2 player teams. This version also includes a fourth character option and some general improvements. In all, while this program isn't the best thing ever, I'm still proud I was able to do so much with such limitted knowledge.
